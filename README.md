# Drum Separator

This project is about separating drums from a music using Facebook's Demucs model. I am still working on UI.

In order for this project to work you need FFMPEG backend defined in system variables and soundfile library.

TODO: 
- Turn drum sound file into a MIDI
- Turn MIDI into a drum notation.
